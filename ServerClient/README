Server and Client Details

This program was originally a project for my Operating Systems course.
It uses a sliding puzzle to demonstrate communication between a client and server via message queues.

The two files server.c and client.c can be compiled on two different Linux terminals
and will be able to communicate with each other.

The programs can be compiled using the following commands, respectively:

$ gcc -D_POSIX_SOURCE -Wall -g -std=c99 -o server server.c -lrt
$ gcc -Wall -g -std=c99 -o client client.c -lrt

The following commands can be used in the client's terminal to shift the board:

$ ./client up
$ ./client down
$ ./client left
$ ./client right
The final command: can be used to print the current board:
$ ./client board

The server must be compiled and executed first. It can be executed with:
$ ./server

Here is an example after the server has been compiled and executed, followed
by the compilation of the client:
$ ./client board
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15  -
$ ./client down
success
$ ./client board
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11  -
13 14 15 12

Both can be killed with ctrl-C. When the server is killed with ctrl-C, it will show the final board state.
