Vehicle Rental Manager Details

This program was originally a project for my Data Structures course.
It is a hypothetical system for checking out rental vehicles.

The program reads a csv file and stores it as a graph/adjacency list.

Here is an example of the file contents:

START_DAY,END_DAY,COST,MAKE,MODEL
1,2,85,Chevrolet,Tahoe
1,4,255,Toyota,Prius
2,5,220,Ford,Explorer
4,5,50,Honda,Accord
2,3,65,Jeep,Compass
3,5,90,Ford,Explorer
3,4,55,Kia,Soul
1,5,500,Honda,CRV
1,3,180,Chevrolet,Silverado
2,4,90,Jeep,Cherokee

Each line is comprised of the day a rental vehicle is available to rent, the day
it must be returned, the cost for this rental, the make, and the model.

The days act as vertices for the graph and the cost as weights for the edges.

The commands are as follows:
Rentals: view the cheapest rental option available from a start to end day
	-Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most inexpensive path on the graph
Day: view a list of rentals available starting on a given day
	-Lists the outgoing edges from a particular day
Quit: exit the Vehicle Rental Manager
Help: view the commands
