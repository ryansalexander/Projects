# Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio. I have included three projects here that I believe showcase some of my skills as a software developer. Due to copyrights on most of my professional work, the projects I am able to share come from my college experience. While some may not be as extensive or as complex as my professional work, I believe they still exhibit my skills and talents. Included below is a brief summary of each project.

### Seafloor Showdown
A project for my senior game development course, developed in Unity and sponsered by Red Storm Entertainment. This is the largest project I am able to share and showcases the work I am able to produce when part of a team.

### Server and Client
A small assignment in which I learned how to make two terminals communicate accross a network using C. This is a very basic example of my work with networks, Seafloor Showdown contains examples on a larger scale.

### Vehicle Rental Manager
A small scale project using Dijkstra's algorithm and an adjacency list intended to showcase my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Data strucures and algorithms are a passion of mine and I have since developed an intimate knowledge of many different types of each.
