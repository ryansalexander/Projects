# Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio. I have included three projects here that I believe showcase some of my skills as a software developer. Due to copyrights on most of my professional work, the projects I am able to share come from my college experience. While some may not be as extensive or as complex as my professional work, I believe they still exhibit my skills and talents. Included below is a brief summary of each project.

## Seafloor Showdown

## Server and Client

## Vehicle Rental Manager
