Game Description:

In Seafloor Showdown, you challenge your friends in an underwater arena to see who is the best Submarine pilot. Each player controls a submarine capable of extending a long net behind it, which can be used to encircle schools of fish. Catching fish will earn the player points, and the player with the most points wins! Treasure can also be found and collected, and used in between rounds to purchase upgrades for your submarine. But beware! Your opponents can interfere with your plans by cutting your net or using power-ups against you. Catching too many fish may also catch the attention of a deadly shark lurking nearby...
