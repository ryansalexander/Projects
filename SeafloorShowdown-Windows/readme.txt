Project Description:
Seafloor Showdown is a game built in Unity for my senior game development course in college. Red Storm Entertainment prompted my team to develop a game that pushed Unity's new (at the time) Entity Component System to its limits, sending a large number of entities over the network we constructed for gameplay. This spawned the idea of submarines attempting to catch large schools of fish (i.e. many entities). While it could certainly use a little polish and updating, this stands as a project that I am still proud of, especially for one developed my college students in the Spring of 2020. Due to copyrighted code, I am not able to share most of the larger projects I have worked on, leaving Seafloor Showdown as my largest public project. The description and trailer below were produced alongside the game and Seafloor Showdown can be played on windows by one or more players.


Game Description:

In Seafloor Showdown, you challenge your friends in an underwater arena to see who is the best Submarine pilot. Each player controls a submarine capable of extending a long net behind it, which can be used to encircle schools of fish. Catching fish will earn the player points, and the player with the most points wins! Treasure can also be found and collected, and used in between rounds to purchase upgrades for your submarine. But beware! Your opponents can interfere with your plans by cutting your net or using power-ups against you. Catching too many fish may also catch the attention of a deadly shark lurking nearby...
